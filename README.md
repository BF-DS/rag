# RAG Project

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using Python. RAG combines information retrieval with generative models to answer queries based on both external documents and language model capabilities.

## Features

- Document ingestion and splitting
- Vectorization of documents for efficient retrieval
- Integration with a language model for generating answers

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Main script to run the RAG pipeline.
